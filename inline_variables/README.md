inline variables can be used for the creation of "header only" source files.
where duplicate linking errors would occour in previous version of C++ in C++17 you can just add inline to
the variable decleration and it will link to the right variable. This example is just some dummy classes I wrote
to be able to test out inline to create a "header only" source file.
